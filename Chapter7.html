                    <p>With the implementation of the Education (Eighth Amendment) Act, 2073, the Higher Secondary Education Council has been abolished and the National Examination Board has become functional. The work related to affiliation school permission, scholarship, school operation, which was being done by the previous Higher Secondary Education Council, will be managed by the local level and the work related to curriculum development, development and equivalence determination will be done by the Curriculum Development Center. The work related to the examination of Class 10 (SEE) and the examination of Classes 11 and 12 (SLCE) has been included within the jurisdiction of the National Examination Board. In addition, the responsibility of conducting the examination of Class 10 at the provincial level and guiding the examination of the entire school education has been included within the scope of the National Examination Board.

                        As per the provisions of the Act, the main work of the National Examination Board, established for the conduct, management and upgradation of school education examinations, is focused on the development of the examination system. The National Examination Board is defined in the Education Act as an autonomous and corporate body with perpetual succession. The Board has its own separate seal for all its activities. All the functions that were being carried out by the Office of the Controller of Examinations of the Higher Secondary Education Council are being conducted by the National Board. The movable/immovable assets and liabilities in the name of the Higher Secondary Education Council have been transferred to the Board.</p>
