                    <p><br><br>As we know every computerized device does not work by itself. They needed to be given some sort of command that makes computer work. These commands helps to instruct computer and program specific action required by the user. Since the command are given in the form of computer language, we need programming language are used to write the set of instruction which commands the computer to perform certain action collectively called programs. These programs are again integrated in order to make a complete software. Simply software is the collection of different interrelated program which performs specific function.

                        Program Written in any type of programming language are not understood by the computer hence we need some sort of language translator or processor such as assembler, complier and interpreter which has the basic function of converting program written in any type of language into machine level language.
                        
                        The program written by the programmer is known as source program. After converting it becomes program.</p>
